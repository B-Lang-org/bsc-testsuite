This directory contains code for a "problem set" for students learning
Bluespec SystemVerilog. The problem set focuses on the problem of FIFO
arbitration. In particular, each of the design blocks (Block1.bsv, 
Block2.bsv, Block2b.bsv, Block3.bsv) contains an implementation of a 
different FIFO arbitration scheme, for the case of two input FIFOs and
one output FIFO.
