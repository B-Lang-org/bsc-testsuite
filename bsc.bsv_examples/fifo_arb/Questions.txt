FIFO Arbiter Questions
----------------------

1. Compile and run Block1 with its testbench (Tb1). What output do you see? 
Is it what you expected? Why or why not? What is the connection between
the warning message the compiler prints and the output you observe?

2. Study the output RTL for Block1. Point to the lines that ensure that
no data is read from a FIFO that is empty and that no data is 
enqueued onto a FIFO that is full.

3. Compile and run Block2 and Block2b with their testbenches (Tb2 and Tb2b).  
Describe the two arbitration schemes and how they are different. Give an 
example of an input sequence on which the two arbitration schemes will give 
qualitatively different results.

4. Compile and run Block3 with its testbench (Tb3). Describe its arbitration 
scheme and give an example of an input sequence where Block3 and Block2b will 
differ in their output.

Note: Please look at the included Makefile if you have questions about how to
compile and run the blocks and the testbenches. If you decide to use a Verilog
simulator, please remember you will need to provide your own top-level driver
file that will instantiate, reset and clock the testbench (which will 
instantiate and stimulate the arbiter block you are working with). 
We recommend that you use a driver like the one in 
BLUESPECDIR/lib/Verilog/main.v, which has been provided as an example.
