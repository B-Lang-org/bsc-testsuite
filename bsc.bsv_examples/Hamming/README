This directory contains two (only slightly different) versions of a
package to generate "Hamming numbers".  They are described in comments
in the source.

HammingQ is a "problem set" for students learning BSV.  It has gaps,
which the students are invited to fill in; and it must then be
debugged.  It compiles, but does not synthesize.

Hamming has the gaps filled in, and is a working version.
