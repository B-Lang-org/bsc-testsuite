This directory contains two (only slightly different) versions of a
package that provides alternatives to ordinary BSV registers. These
alternatives are implemented (in BSV) in terms of ordinary registers
and the RWire primitive and are described in comments in the source.  

RegisterQ is a "problem set" for students learning BSV.  It has gaps,
which the students are invited to fill in; and it must then be
debugged.  It compiles (with warnings about undefined interface
fields), but does not synthesize.

Register has the gaps filled in, and is a working version.
