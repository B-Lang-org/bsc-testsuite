This directory contains transaction-level models of a bus protocol,
using specific AMBA adapters.  These adapters provide simple
intrfaces, which are not abma protocol specific, thus allowing the
same models to connect with different bus implementations or models.


TODO:

-- Use OInt for slave select -- except that is one-hot all zeros OK
-- File bug for OInt type needs to be using for rule analysis
-- Master Select hmaster is a 4 bit value
-- review mkIfcMaster/Slave   can these be simiplfied.
-- combine all work into packages
        AmbaTModels
        AmbaSModels
   DMA
   DMA_Envir
-- see if there are simulation differences with them (Rob)
-- Check hack for one hot.
-- Needs version with OInt fixes
-- Sort port list via method name.....
-- rename methods to match pinouts.
