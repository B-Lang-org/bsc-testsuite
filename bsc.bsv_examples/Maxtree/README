This directory contains BSV source code for several different
implementation of a max-tree module.   One that selected the maximum
data from a list in a tree like comparison.

There are three source files in this directory
TestPush.bsv -- gives multiple examples of the use of the Push
             library.  The Push library is useful for implementing
             pipeline and other composable functions in BSV.
MaxTree.bsv -- builds several examples of the max-tree modules, but
             first defines and describes several polymorphic functions
             which are used and can be reused for this and other
             implementations of a max-tree implementations.
TestMaxTree.bsv -- builds several test benches some variations of the
             max-tree implementations.

Compiling
% TestPush
bsc -verilog TestPush.bsv
% will create several Verilog files -- descriptions are in source code

% MaxTree
bsc -verilog MaxTree.bsv
% will create several Verilog files with variations of max-tree
% implementation;  descriptions are in source code

% TestMaxTree
bsc -verilog TestMaxTree.bsv
% will create several Verilog files which implement testbenches for
% some of the max-tree implementations.
