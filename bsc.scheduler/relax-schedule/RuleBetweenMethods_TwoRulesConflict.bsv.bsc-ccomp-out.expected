Error: "RuleBetweenMethods_TwoRulesConflict.bsv", line 37, column 9: (G0100)
  The rules `RL_top_rule_1' and `RL_top_rule_3' require dynamic scheduling,
  which is not supported by Bluesim. This is because the rules use methods
  which have a rule that executes between them in the static execution order
  of the separately synthesized submodule, but the rules must execute in the
  opposite order according to the current module's schedule. See entry #30 in
  the KPNS document for more information and possible solutions.
  The methods and the rules between them are as follows:
    (sub.method2, sub.method1)
      RL_sub_rule
  The execution order path is as follows:
    `RL_top_rule_1' -> `RL_top_rule_2' -> `RL_top_rule_3'
  The relationships were introduced for the following reasons:
    (RL_top_rule_1, RL_top_rule_2)
    execution order because of calls to rg12.write vs. rg12.read
    (RL_top_rule_2, RL_top_rule_3)
    execution order because of calls to rg23.write vs. rg23.read
