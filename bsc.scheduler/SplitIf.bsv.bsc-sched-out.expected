Warning: "SplitIf.bsv", line 6, column 8: (G0020)
  System functions (e.g., $display) called by interface methods execute in an
  unpredictable order during Verilog simulations.
      Top-level interface method `xfer' calls a system function (e.g.,
      $display) at the following positions:
	  "SplitIf.bsv", line 26, column 7
	  "SplitIf.bsv", line 31, column 7
Warning: "SplitIf.bsv", line 6, column 8: (G0117)
  Rule `xfer_F' shadows the effects of `toggle2' when they execute in the same
  clock cycle. Affected method calls:
    r2.write
  To silence this warning, use the `-no-warn-action-shadowing' flag.
